                </div>
                <p>Joyce Yu-Jean Lee's short film, <em>Invisible Visible</em>, tells the artist's story of facing
                    censorship while producing a new media work exposing the limits of Internet freedom. In 2016, Lee
                    first exhibited <em>FIREWALL Cafe</em>, her interactive installation artwork which allows audiences
                    to see side-by-side comparisons of image searches from Google in the U.S. with Baidu in China. When
                    Chinese authorities intervened in the inaugural New York City exhibition to prevent a Chinese
                    women's rights lawyer from participating, <em>FIREWALL Cafe</em>'s platform for bringing attention
                    to censorship grew.</p>
                <p>
                    Lee's documentary extends beyond Firewall, to share stories of other artists, journalists and
                    researchers using technology to illuminate the mechanics of censorship which otherwise would go
                    unseen. The film features hacktivist Charlie Smith of Great Fire; Pulitzer Prize winning New York
                    Times journalist Megha Rajagopala; and Austrian curator and art historian, Julia Hartmann and Jason
                    Q. Ng.

                <p><em>FIREWALL Cafe</em> is an interactive dual image search website created by artist Joyce Yu-Jean
                    Lee. Laying bare limits to Internet freedom, <em>FIREWALL Cafe</em> is designed to foster public
                    dialogue about Internet freedom. Visitors are invited to search for internet images through FIREWALL
                    and, with side-by-side results from the two browsers, vote on perceived censorship in the search
                    results. </p>
                <p>
                    Each vote is archived in a public research database through this socially engaged research project.
                    Visualizing the urgent and rapidly-evolving issue of Internet censorship, <em>FIREWALL Cafe</em>
                    offers users first-hand interaction with information manipulation on the Internet. The work explores
                    user's perception of censorship, a key consideration for netizens in the U.S. amidst legislative
                    debates over federal bans on the cultural content leader and Chinese app TikTok.
