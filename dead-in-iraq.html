                <p>Game based performative intervention and memorial, 2006-2011, 18:56</p>
                <p>This work commenced in March of 2006, to roughly coincide with the 3rd anniversary of the start of
                    the
                    Iraq
                    conflict. I enter the online US Army recruiting game, "America's Army", in order to manually type
                    the
                    name,
                    age,
                    service branch and date of death of each service person who has died to date in Iraq. The work is
                    essentially a
                    fleeting, online memorial to those military personnel who have been killed in this ongoing conflict.
                    My
                    actions
                    are also intended as a cautionary gesture. I enter the game using as my login name, "dead-in-iraq"
                    and
                    proceed
                    to type the names using the game's text messaging system. I stand in position and type until I am
                    killed.
                    After
                    death, I hover over my dead avatar's body and continue to type. Upon being re-incarnated in the next
                    round,
                    I
                    continue the cycle. As of 12/18/2011, the official withdrawal date of the last U.S. troops in Iraq,
                    I
                    completed
                    the input of the last 200+ names into the game, for a total of 4484 names. (source <a
