                <h1>Curatorial Statement</h1>
                <p>As you enter Baruch College&rsquo;s Newman Library, immediately to the right of the circulation desk
                    you encounter the very first screening room of the New Media Artspace<em>.</em> Beginning with the
                    piece <em>Elegy: GTA USA Gun Homicides</em> (level 2) we have an immediate sense that the familiar
                    action-adventure game environment of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> has been appropriated and
                    reprogrammed in a specific way. The initial game introduction is absent and the otherwise active
                    protagonist inadvertently becomes the viewer as a statistically-fed algorithmic cycle of violence is
                    visualized. With this unfolding we get the first glimpse into the practice of artist Joseph DeLappe.
                    In a strategy familiar to contemporary artists today, DeLappe utilizes open-source and publicly
                    available software as well as web-based news media to reconfigure and present a message within the
                    space from which the media itself is drawn. At times collaborating with creative coders and game
                    designers Joseph DeLappe performs or re-enacts history to send his own message which often
                    undermines the chosen space&rsquo;s own ethos. DeLappe circulates his complex collages or
                    &ldquo;mash-ups,&rdquo; within the platforms he often critiques. In the timely piece <em>The Origins
                        of Totalitarianism: A Reading by Donald Trump</em> (on level 4) the artist adopts the form of
                    familiar news spots (depicting former President Donald Trump speaking to the media) and juxtaposes
                    them with the historical text by German-American historian and philosopher, Hannah Arendt. Using
                    free, user-friendly and accessible artificial intelligence software (in this case a voice emulator)
                    the artist generates a voice track and corresponding lip-synching of <em>The Origins of
                        Totalitarianism</em> ultimately mapping the lip synch to the moving face of Donald Trump to
                    create what the artist himself calls a &ldquo;shallow-fake.&rdquo; A riff on the feared practice of
                    using artificial intelligence&rsquo;s deep learning tools to deceive or construct media that is
                    meant to pass as factual representation. In this case, the artist foregrounds the synthetic nature
                    of the images by immediately delineating the two software packages used to create the piece in the
                    opening credits. In other words, communicating to the viewer that this is not a &ldquo;deep,&rdquo;
                    fake, but rather a &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; one. It is this transparent and open approach to creating
                    art work that invites the audience to participate in and possibly attempt their own intervention in
                    our shared visual culture.</p>
                <p>As stated above level 2 begins with <em>Elegy: GTA USA Gun Homicides</em> a game modification and
                    data visualization artwork that re-enacted the total gun homicides beginning in January of 2018. The
                    project itself launched on July 4th of 2018 and would re-enact each midnight the updated statistics
                    for gun homicides in the United States. Gun homicide statistics were updated daily and fed
                    algorithmically into the game from the website <em>Gun Violence Archive</em> and each total was
                    re-visualized in a different way using the algorithm and graphics of the video game. The piece was
                    live streamed for the duration of a year ending on July 4th, 2019. In the video documenting the
                    project (for this exhibition) inhabitants randomly brandish guns and begin shooting neighboring
                    bystanders accompanied by the historical radio broadcast of <em>God Bless America</em> (as
                    originally performed by Kate Smith in 1938). The violence abates for small periods of time as
                    characters in the space walk through (or knock into) the cumulative bodies laid out within the
                    virtual landscape. The seeming indifference of these inhabitants is an eerie reminder of just how
                    accustomed (and perhaps numb) US citizens have become to the endless school shootings and random gun
                    violence that continues to go unchecked in our society. The work provokes us to face our own
                    inaction and conditioned indifference. Faced with these questions the viewer&rsquo;s experience of
                    the exhibition begins. <em>Algorithms of Resistance: The Work of Joseph DeLappe</em> is a selection
                    of artworks that look at how an artist enacts resistance and executes his own personal protocol (or
                    algorithm) utilizing a variety of virtual tools and online media.</p>
                <p>As the exhibition proceeds, on the next floor (level 3) we are presented with <em>dead-in-iraq</em>
                    where a different kind of patriotism is at play. The virtual environment of <em>America&rsquo;s
                        Army</em> is dramatized by punctuating gunshots as players in the space make their way through
                    what appears to be a residential neighborhood in Iraq. The first-person shooter game
                    <em>America&rsquo;s Army</em> was developed and released by the Department of Defense and the US
                    Army as a public relations and recruitment tool in 2002. Development of the game was financed by the
                    US Government and civilian tax dollars. Within DeLappe&rsquo;s video documentation of
                    <em>dead-in-iraq</em>, single-story homes are raided and presumably suspected insurgents are
                    engaged. In this chaotic scene the player through which we experience and enter the space throws
                    down his weapon and continues walking through the terrain. He is suddenly killed and his subsequent
                    interaction is played out through the text feature of the video game. The now dead player types in
                    the name, rank, age, and military branch of a real-world US armed services casualty. The names typed
                    in by the artist are sourced from <em>icasualties.org</em> an independent website founded by Micheal
                    White to track casualties in both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. In this act a haunting parallel is
                    drawn between the virtual death of the player and the real information connected to an actual death
                    in Iraq. The artist contracts the distance between the virtual theater of <em>America&rsquo;s
                        Army</em> and the real-life space of the Iraq war. This work is amongst the most engrossing and
                    poignant. How do we as US Citizens continue our escapism and consumption in the face of war abroad?
                    The work raises a whole series of uncomfortable questions. Is presenting the fantasy of a sterile
                    and disembodied experience shaping the way US citizens learn to imagine war? Perhaps questions are
                    the answers we have been looking for?
                </p>
                <p>As we leave <em>dead-in-iraq</em> and ascend the staircase to the next level (level 4) we encounter
                    <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism: A Reading by Donald Trump.</em> A video depicting (ostensibly)
                    Donald Trump reading a chapter from Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s book <em>The Origins of
                        Totalitarianism.</em> The video immediately foregrounds its use of artificial intelligence by
                    enlarging those two letters (AI) in its title. As the work plays out the manipulated nature of the
                    video becomes more and more apparent in what the artist describes as a &ldquo;shallow fake,&rdquo; a
                    reference to the discourse and practice of using artificial intelligence&rsquo;s deep learning tools
                    to generate media that are synthetic in nature or as they are called, a &ldquo;deep fake.&rdquo; The
                    familiar space and context of a political speech is algorithmically re-engineered to present the
                    artist&rsquo;s own message. Through a classic gesture of appropriation, the artist activates a
                    historical text asking us to consider its relevance today, in 2024. The work also makes reference to
                    the use of social media and online platforms in disseminating &ldquo;fake news.&rdquo; By debuting
                    and circulating the artwork online the artist again raises questions about the veracity of online
                    media.
                </p>
                <p>At last, we arrive at level 5 where we come face-to-face with a computer console placed a top
                    a Catholic church kneeler. The interactive artwork, <em>The Computerized Confessional</em> is based
                    on the pioneering work of computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum. Weizenbaum developed an early
                    version of what is today called a chatbot. DeLappe originally developed the artwork in 1984 as a
                    &ldquo;skeptical&rdquo; look into engagement with automated digital platforms, the piece echoes the
                    original concerns of Weizenbaum toward the use of artificial intelligence. Instead of replacing a
                    psychotherapist with the chatbot <em>Eliza</em>, as Weizenbaum had done, the artist replaces the
                    priest with the very same technology. Representing the work here in the New Media Artspace, the
                    artist asks us again, do we engage with this technology? are we looking at yet another form of a
                    dispositif? can we trust artificial intelligence? How do we resist and assert our own algorithm?</p>
