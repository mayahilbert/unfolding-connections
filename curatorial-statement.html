                <h1>Curatorial Statement</h1>
                <p>The title for this exhibition is selected from a constellation of works by the Asian-American artist
                    Joyce Yu-Jean Lee. The first unfolding comes from the artist's desire to excavate her family's
                    history. In <em>Unfolding Nai Nai</em> (fourth floor) the artist reaches out to her aunts, uncles
                    and father to learn more about her paternal grandmother. An émigré who was displaced by the
                    Communist Revolution in 1949, Nai Nai took her four children and flew first to Shanghai, then
                    eventually out of China. The work's own opacity mirrors the challenge in reconstructing the life and
                    personality of a family member through the lens of those surrounding her. By the time Nai Nai is
                    interviewed a sense of her indomitable personality and penchant for artistic creation is already
                    established. She shares her experience of rearing children and demonstrates her focus and skill at
                    transforming discarded paper into functional objects and crafty representations. Through these
                    scenes we recognize an immediate connection to her own granddaughter's creative output.
                    <em>Unfolding
                        Connections</em> tracks a contemporary artist's search for knowledge, identity, and
                    understanding as she
                    unravels the web of mediations that obscure and contain her families roots in China.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The piece <em>What It's Like, What It Is</em> on the top (fifth) floor brings us back immediately to
                    the recent history of the 2020 pandemic. The global health crisis unleashed a local thinly-veiled
                    xenophobic hostility toward Asian-Americans as misinformation on the COVID-19 virus' origin began to
                    spread throughout the internet. Asian-Americans found themselves a target in their own communities,
                    and this piece was made, as the artist states:
                    A text-based animation made in collaboration and solidarity with the Asian American community in NYC
                    when violence against Asians erupted at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Made in homage to Adrian
                    Piper's video installation, "What It's Like, What It Is #3 (1991)," a … video displays words
                    submitted by members of the community: both derogatory and stereotyping words that they have been
                    labeled by strangers, as well as positive words that reframe, redefine and reclaim their identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simplicity of the work shows the mobility and power words have to shape, reassert or attack
                    notions of what it means to be Asian and American in New York City. The piece appears here as a
                    single channel video iteration of a two-channel work. The animated quality of the words flashing on
                    and off on each screen (in rapid intervals) reflects the speed at which these notions and words
                    circulate in the public domain. From piecing together her matriarchal roots, to utilizing art to
                    dispel erroneous misconceptions, the artist turns her attention to the Internet.
                    Can the channels of communication which make up the Internet help us understand who we are as
                    citizens? Are our ethnic roots accessible through clearly monitored, often privatized and curated
                    lines of communication? Do older forms of communication, oral history, testimony allow us a more
                    direct understanding of our present and our past? These are some of the questions that drive Lee's
                    work. Her photographic series <em>Passages III</em> featured in the display cases on the fourth and
                    fifth floor document the artist's trips to her family's country of origin, China, as well as
                    diasporic “homes” in Taiwan, Hong Kong and New York City. The photographs capture transnational
                    residents framed by political history, and impacted by their cultural and economic interactions with
                    the West. Street scenes show the city's inhabitants carrying out their daily lives as the artist
                    discreetly records their presence. In addition to her family's own journey, <em>Passages III</em>
                    also shares the artist's interest in oculi and their ability to both shape and direct light as it
                    moves from one space into another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally <em>Unfolding Connections</em> culminates in the artist's work, <em>FIREWALL Cafe</em>, on
                    floors two and three. <em>FIREWALL</em> looks at China's primary search engine, Baidu and allows you
                    to compare it simultaneously to our own most widely used search engine, Google. The comparison of
                    image search results reveals how some keyword searches are curated or at least directed toward a
                    specific area. An image search of “3D printed weapons” using Google displays a variety of ghost
                    guns, while the comparable search in Baidu only shows one image of a printed gun amongst a larger
                    collection of images of knives. Based on these searches one gets a sense of the limits of both
                    search engines, and how their predetermined limits can shape our dominant imaginary. The difference
                    is subtle, but as the amount and scope of your searches accumulates, the results raise a number of
                    questions. What pool of data is Baidu searching? And is it part or separate from a larger database
                    of images available to Google users? Are the results algorithmically filtered in real time, or are
                    their independent parameters native to the search engine itself? As the artist reveals in her
                    documentary on the artwork, <em>Invisible Visible</em>, the censorship is layered. Companies in
                    China who want to have a web presence must register their website with the government and must abide
                    by government regulations. In addition to this, Lee suspects searches are also determined regionally
                    depending on where you are located in China. The “Golden Shield Project,” (as the artist states)
                    imposes external filtering on websites, a practice often referred to as the “Great Firewall of
                    China.” Lee's project did not go unnoticed by Chinese authorities in 2016, and was subsequently
                    presented in a number of sites internationally. </p>
                <p>
                    The third-floor iteration of <em>FIREWALL Cafe</em>, allows visitors to see and browse through
                    keyword searches that were executed since the project's inception in 2016. The project remains as
                    relevant today as the year it debuted. The banning of Tik Tok in the United States recently
                    reanimates the battle over censorship and internet freedom. Lee's work displays in real time how
                    politics interfere with our ability to seek truth and understand the greater world we live in.
                    Should state policy govern how we shape our notions through accessible media? Unfolding Connections
                    takes us through that complex process of forming our own identity, and understanding how notions of
                    truth are shaped by media and our socio-political environment. </p>
                <p><em>Joyce Yu-Jean Lee: Unfolding Connections</em> is curated by Dennis Delgado, Assistant
